      <p>
        I have always been a very curious person and someone who wants to keep
        learning. With a background in psychology, content creation, gaming, and
        esports, I have a very unique skill set that blends my creative mind
        with my analytical one. Being adaptable and a fast learner brought me to
        teaching myself how to code and create websites! I bring my energy to
        all my creations and love expressing emotions, aesthetics, or
        personality to my websites.
